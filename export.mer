We provide a critical edition and translation of a number of key passages. We show that this version of the text can be used to eluci- date some of Menelaus' concerns as a mathematician, to study al-Haraw<i->'s work as an editor and as a mathematical scholar, and to understand the early efforts of the Abb sid translators of technical works into Arabic.<e""> {AbstractEnd} {Time=""7/30/2015 8:42:13 AM""} {User=""Nathan""} {/Metadata}","WebPub","On 7/30/2015 at 7:55:49 AM by Nathan on WillThompson","9/10/2015 3:11:25 PM","checked out","sr","","","2015.07.30 Nathan","2015.07.30 Nathan","","","","","{Tagged data} {Field=""Title""} {Tag type=""Title of a work""} {Tag content=""Spherics""} {Time=""7/30/2015 8:44:03 AM""} {User=""Nathan""} {/Tagged data} {full citation}JournalArticle|1552031|Nathan Sidoli, Takanori Kusuba||Al-Haraw<i->'s Version of Menelaus' <e>Spherics</e>|213||Suhayl: Journal for the History of the Exact and Natural Sciences in Islamic Civilisation|149--212|||1552023|The Transmission of Arabic Astronomical Tables in Sanskrit, Latin, and Chinese. an Early Step in the Internationalization of Science?: Introduction||Matthieu Husson, Clemency Montelle::::Thu Jul 30 08:45:30 2015 by Nathan {full citation}<newline>{full citation}JournalArticle|1552031|Nathan Sidoli, Takanori Kusuba||Al-Haraw<i->'s Version of Menelaus' <e>Spherics</e>|213|||149--212|||1552023|The Transmission of Arabic Astronomical Tables in Sanskrit, Latin, and Chinese. an Early Step in the Internationalization of Science?: Introduction||Matthieu Husson, Clemency Montelle::::Thu Sep 10 15:09:52 2015 by sr {full citation}","","1552023","","Review","Chapter","Review",,,,,,,,"",,,,,,"1552031","213","13","149--212","","The Transmission of Arabic Astronomical Tables in Sanskrit, Latin, and Chinese. an Early Step in the Internationalization of Science?: Introduction","Matthieu Husson, Clemency Montelle","","2014","","","","","","","","","","","",""
